## About me
 - A student study physics in Whuhan University,with great intrest in physics and coding.
 - It's time to python! Besides python, I have learned about C langage and MATLAB, but did not use them frequently.I have used MATLAB to do some work, such as plot the datas, analyse the pictures, find out the peak of a series of Raman spectrums ,and also some simple MD programs.
 - Nothing could match to a passionate heart ,which want to learn new things.
