## About me
 - A student study physics in Whuhan University,with great intrest in physics and coding.
 - It's time to python! Besides python, I have learned about C langage and MATLAB, but did not use them frequently.I have used MATLAB to do some work, such as plot the datas, analyse the pictures, find out the peak of a series of Raman spectrums ,and also some simple MD programs.
 - Nothing could match to a passionate heart ,which want to learn new things.

## About my program
 > - Actually, this is my homwork page,I would submit my computationalphysics homework here,as follows:
 > - This is my **4th** homework  and the report [*the parachute model*](https://www.zybuluo.com/feipai11/note/322097).
 > - This is my **5th** homework and the report [*the populatin model*](https://www.zybuluo.com/feipai11/note/330031).
